# FFXI-Scripts
A collection of scripts for FFXI, for use with Windower and Ashita

## Windower

For any of the Windower scripts, place them in the `scripts` sub-directory in your program files. E.g. `Windower4/scripts`.

Execute the script in game with `//lua e <script_name>` (without the file extension). For example, to run `missingBlueMagic.lua`, you would type:

```
//lua e missingBlueMagic
```

## Ashita
